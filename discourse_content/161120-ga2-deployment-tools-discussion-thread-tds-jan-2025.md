Important Instruction
---------------------


Please use markdown code formatting (fenced code blocks) when sharing code in Discourse posts. This makes the code much easier to read and differentiate from non\-code text. It also makes it easier for people to copy code snippets and run it themselves. Visit this link for more details: [Extended Syntax \| Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks).


A friendly suggestion: kindly go through [Discourse Docs](/c/docs-discourse/45)! ![:slight_smile:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/slight_smile.png?v=12 ":slight_smile:")

that website is working fine . just write the parameters after /api


@Jivraj Singh Shekhawat said: Hi Guddu,


Can you share your GitHub repo. For GitHub pages question.


@Jivraj Singh Shekhawat said: Check your browser console most probably CORS is causing problem.


Try adding CORS to your code it might work.


Kind regards  

Jivraj

[@carlton](/u/carlton) can you please tell me what is wrong in this because I am getting “Error: Response undefined does not match expected” to my answer

I tired multiple times but issue is still there.  

[@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) Kindly help me out.


@Carlton D'Silva said: Hi Mishkat,


Please use triple backticks to encapsulate code, so that we can debug your code more easily.


eg



```
if __name__ == "__main__":
   print ("Hello")

```

Please use this discourse etiquette to share code.


Thanks and kind regards


@Guddu Kumar Mishra said: sir did you check yet what is the problem in this one?


@Mishkat Chougule said: 
```
from fastapi import FastAPI, Query
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from typing import List, Optional
import csv

app = FastAPI()

# Enable CORS
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins=["*"],  # Allow all origins
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],  # Allow all methods
    allow_headers=["*"],  # Allow all headers
)

# Load student data from the specified CSV file
students = []
with open('/Users/mish/Downloads/q-fastapi.csv', mode='r') as file:
    reader = csv.DictReader(file)
    for row in reader:
        students.append({
            "studentId": int(row["studentId"]),
            "class": row["class"]
        })

@app.get("/api")
async def get_students(class_: Optional[List[str]] = Query(None)):
    print(f"Requested classes: {class_}")  # Debugging line
    if class_:
        filtered_students = [student for student in students if student["class"] in class_]
        print(f"Filtered students: {filtered_students}")  # Debugging line
        return {"students": filtered_students}
    return {"students": students}

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, host="127.0.0.1", port=8000)

```

@Jivraj Singh Shekhawat said: Hi Mishkat,


This error is because you are filtering on `class_` instead of `class`


So if you send a request on `http://127.0.0.1/api?class_=1S` you will see response for that `1S` class only.


kind regards


@Mishkat Chougule said: thank you so much after modifying the code it got accepted


@Jivraj Singh Shekhawat said: Hi Guddu,


Inside `index.html` file of your repo, don’t put html code just put your email in the file nothing else.


This issue is because when you deploy on github pages it encrypts any email that’s on page.


kind regards.


@Nelson Jochim DSouza said: I am facing an issue with Docker Desktop.


[![Docker Desktop Error](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/7/d7bcf7a2f709561b98fa8bde031ab5d1e81a4a0d.png)Docker Desktop Error558×377 27 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/d/7/d7bcf7a2f709561b98fa8bde031ab5d1e81a4a0d.png "Docker Desktop Error")


I have uninstalled and installed Docker (run as administrator).


wsl \-\-version



```
WSL version: 2.3.26.0
Kernel version: 5.15.167.4-1
WSLg version: 1.0.65
MSRDC version: 1.2.5620
Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
DXCore version: 10.0.26100.1-240331-1435.ge-release
Windows version: 10.0.19045.5011

```

Tried many solutions after googling for the issue.  

So far no solution. Anyone else faced this issue and found a solution?


@Jivraj Singh Shekhawat said: Hi Telvin,


Try opening `localhost:8080` in browser if that works, if it opens in browser then issue might be with some network configurations.


I solved this question in github codespace, which didn’t require me to make any changes in network.


kind regards


kind regards


@Anand S said: [@Nelson](/u/nelson) I would recommend [Podman](https://podman.io/) or [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) rather than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).


Docker Desktop is [not free for organizations over 250 people](https://docs.docker.com/subscription/desktop-license/) and many organizations have therefore moved away from it.


@Telvin Varghese said: [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I tired , in browser localhost:8080 is working fine but ngrok is not working. Is there any other tools for tunneling that can be used.


@Anand S said: [@22f2001640](/u/22f2001640) in that case


* a firewall or local security settings might block access to port 8080, or
* a network restriction is blocking access to port 8080


Please try one of these:


* Try the same on a personal laptop on a public / home network
* GitHub codespaces, as [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) suggested


You *could* try an ngrok alternative like [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/) but I don’t think that’ll work.
