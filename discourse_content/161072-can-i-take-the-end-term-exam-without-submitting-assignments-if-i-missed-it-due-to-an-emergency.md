The grading assignment indicates Iâ€™m NOT eligible for a final score. Does that mean this subject wont be considered at all for the final course card?


Can I still take the end\-term exam and be excused from submitting the assignments and projects?

Yes you dont have to submit your assignments but just give the End term. Just check if you have got the I grade


@Shiya Rajendra Ramteke said: Yes, I got I grade, I registered for the courses opting for end term only and not repeating the entire course,


I still got the assignments though, I can complete those, but I am not sure the new ones will be considered for evaluation, please clarify
