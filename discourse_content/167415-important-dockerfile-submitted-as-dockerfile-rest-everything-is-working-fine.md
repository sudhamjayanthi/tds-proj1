I got a mail saying my Dockerfile is missing. However I have a dockerfile already in my github repository. Is it an issue with the spelling of dockerfile since I have submitted it in all small case as ‘dockerfile’. It was showing the score when I checked with the evaluate.py that was provided by iitm.


Shall I just change the name of the file from ‘dockerfile’ to ‘Dockerfile’ in github repository of mine or is there anything else that is needed to detect the Dockerfile?


@Saransh Saini said: The name of the Dockerfile should be “Dockerfile” indeed, more over check other sections of your submission like


* Is the GitHub repo public?
* Does it have an MIT license?
* Does it have a DockerFile?
* Is the Docker image accessible?


@Nayonika Arora said: Oh ok made the changes in Github. I hope submitting again is not required since the links and names are same.

Sir, i got this mail. I have checked that the repo is public and already has a Dockerfile.  

I have renamed the ‘LICENSE’ file as ‘MIT LICENSE’.


@Satvik Sawhney said: Sir, please consider it we have spent a lot of time, in my case just the d in Dockerfile was small that too on remote repository. On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.


Sir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.


Sir it is a humble request to please consider it.


Warm Regards,
