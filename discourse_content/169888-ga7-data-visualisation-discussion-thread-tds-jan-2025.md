@Shreehari Anbazhagan said: Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  

I was working on GA7 as part of Task 4 in 7\.1\. In task 4\.Sheet1, the columns include Series ID, Item, Year, Month, and Value. While I could extract Series ID and Item, I couldn’t locate Year, Month, or Value in the dataset. Could someone please assist me with this?

Monthly Price Indices file have those columns.

In the GA 7\.1 part it is said that we need data of which columns are  

![{7059D6FF-DF75-4B21-999A-29D23A297A90}](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/6/a6fdec02b5239ef02c5198e250c8a2d6eb007b82.png)


but the dataset provided has no column named “Item”  

![{F9711583-E074-489A-AC90-154B9309F786}](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/a/1/a121b005d9edc2469571d46018f450882b3fcb81.png)


@Shreehari Anbazhagan said: Thanks a lot for pointing out and sorry it’s my bad missed it.


@Shreehari Anbazhagan said: Item is there in other sheet we might have to join them to get items.


@Vedant Baburao Kornule said: We have to extract all id’s and their respective item from other sheet and add in first sheet with respect to id’s .


@Anushka Kumar said: [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir I don’t have Microsoft PowerPoint. What should I do ?


@Carlton D'Silva said: Use the free version on Microsoft 365


@Nelson Jochim DSouza said: Below items don’t have prices.

Some items don’t have prices for all 24 months.  

Although the assignment says 24 months (I assumed 2023 January to 2024 December) data, many items have prices for 2025 Jan as well.
