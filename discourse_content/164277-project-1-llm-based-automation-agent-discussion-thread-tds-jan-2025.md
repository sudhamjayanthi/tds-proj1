@Anand S said: Please post any questions related to [Project 1 \- LLM\-based Automation Agent](https://tds.s-anand.net/#/project-1).


Deadline: Sunday, February 16, 2025 6:29 PM


**Update on 27 Jan 2025**:


A *sample* evaluation script for Project 1 tasks A1\-A10 is available at [tools\-in\-data\-science\-public/project\-1 at tds\-2025\-01\-project\-1\-wip · sanand0/tools\-in\-data\-science\-public · GitHub](https://github.com/sanand0/tools-in-data-science-public/tree/tds-2025-01-project-1-wip/project-1)


You can use this to validate your code for Project 1\.


Please note:


1. This is a sample. It **WILL** change.
2. Don’t rely on the dataset being the same. It **WILL** change.
3. LLMs give different results each time they are called. Make sure:
	* Your code gives correct results *reliably* (i.e. try a few times)
	* Change the task in the evaluation script slightly to test variations
4. Your [AI Proxy usage](https://aiproxy.sanand.workers.dev/) resets on 1 Feb. You have a limited budget. Utilize what you can this month.
5. For those who [submit their code](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdOaljgV-INdbKrPotV9OMUKV01QVaFEfcnr5dAxBZqM4x37g/viewform?usp=dialog) by Friday 31 Jan, I will run a sample evaluation and share the results.

sir [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) after editing line 127 in datagen.py i got those required data files. is it allowed ? also i had to run datagen.py MANUALLY(is this process also should be automatic)?


@Jivraj Singh Shekhawat said: Hi Guddu ,


I didn’t make any changes to file and it worked for me. Can you mention what is need of making changes ?


command that I used :  

`uv run datagen.py 22f3002542@ds.study.iitm.ac.in --root ./data`


here \-\-root option defines the folder where you want to store generated data. by default it would try to create a folder in root directory of operating system.


Kind regards

@Aishik Bandyopadhyay said: getting this issue :



```
openai.AuthenticationError: Error code: 401 - {'error': {'message': 'Your authentication token is not from a valid issuer.', 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'param': None, 'code': 'invalid_issuer'}}

```

@Jivraj Singh Shekhawat said: Hi Aishik,


Pls add context to your query, without that we won’t be able to understand, where exactly you are facing problem.

Possible reasons for this issue:


1. Not using anand sir’s proxy url for sending requests.
2. Token not being correct.


@Aishik Bandyopadhyay said: yes I was not setting the base url to the proxy. I have fixed it thank you .


@Aishik Bandyopadhyay said: While implementing task A5, I am confused about what recent actually means in the phrase “recent log file”, mentioned under task A5, in the problem statement. This confusion arises because there are no dates corresponding to the log files. Should I consider log\-0 as the most recent one? or the log\-\<largest\_number\> file? Please clarify.


@Aishik Bandyopadhyay said: I am getting the following response when I am trying to extract credit card number from the credit\-card.png :

@Sathyavathi S said: do we have to do these tasks in the linux? As in some of the GA1, the linux answers only accepted. Please tell me that, do we can do it in the desktop or we have to use linux?

@Saransh Saini said: The bash commands are usually run in a linux machine, but you can easily run those commands in VSCode without installing any virtual machines. Download the WSL extension in VSCode and you will get a WSL terminal to work with.

@Carlton D'Silva said: Project 1 deliverables are all that matter. How you accomplish them is not very relevant. The keys to a successful Project 1 are:  

Deliverables,  

and *an example* of the Evaluation has been provided.  

If your project runs in accordance with the Evaluation methodology then it is considered.  

[![Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/optimized/3X/4/8/488e23f9ea65d35c5ba806fab09f4b5934ed2ed4_2_500x500.png)Screenshot 2025\-01\-27 at 8\.35\.23 am1764×1764 374 KB](https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/iitm/original/3X/4/8/488e23f9ea65d35c5ba806fab09f4b5934ed2ed4.png "Screenshot 2025-01-27 at 8.35.23 am")


Please read the documentation carefully from top to bottom.


So the main question is how do you test if the script will run according to the evaluation? The whole point is for it to run not just on your system. It should be deployable anywhere on any machine. Your solution should work anywhere we test it. Thats why you package it in a docker container. How you achieve that is up to you. But if we cannot run your docker container according to the specification we have provided then it has failed this crucial test.


Kind regards


@Carlton D'Silva said: [@23f1002382](/u/23f1002382)


You can use any library as long as your Project 1 meets the deliverable requirements and does all the (20\+) API tasks.


Kind regards
