@Sudip Dey said: Dear Sir,


I would like to bring this to your attention that even though I submitted the ROE multiple times, the dashboard is showing absent.


I hope the issue will be resolved at earliest as I am not the only one facing this issue

@Shambhavi said: Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) sir,


I wanted to bring to your attention that, although as you are already aware that I was present for the ROE and successfully submitted my exam, my dashboard currently reflects my status as “Absent.”


I have attached a screenshot for your reference. I assume this might be a backend issue or that the scores are still being updated. Could you kindly look into this and confirm?


Thank you

I submitted my exam with perfect 10 score I even went to the technical meet you guys kept and I asked that my score it showing 5/10 but I used the hacking procedure can you please tell what is my score and he said that we will take your highest score only and don’t worry it’s not 5, then I got a invite for the meet you guys kept for those who scored perfectly in the roe, after all this I don’t understand how is my score 60 percent.

@Manit Bohra said: 24F1001631 here. It is also showing absent for me. I had submitted before the time limit and also after the time limit after hacking it(wasn’t sure if it was allowed but decided to try it nevertheless)


I feel I should atleast receive the marks for which I had submitted within the time limit.


My roll number is 24F1001631\.
