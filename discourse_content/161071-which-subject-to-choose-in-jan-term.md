Actually i have 3 diploma subjects to cover \- MLP, JAVA, TDS. So which 2 subject should i choose for this term?


@Rajat Goel said: Don’t take TDS, this subject should be taken in the end else you might have some problem


@Carlton D'Silva said: TDS at the end best. Gives you the best chance of doing well in it.


Kind regards


@Aditya choudhary said: Yes you should do tds after mlp only it really help you alot trust me


@Akash kumbhakar said: You should focus on TDS at latter stage of your diploma
