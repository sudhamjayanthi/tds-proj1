i can’t load my questions


@Anand S said: [@23f1002630](/u/23f1002630) \- thanks for raising this. It’s fixed and won’t re\-occur for anyone.


**What happened?** I picked random duration from the video of 10\-40 seconds, but forgot to ensure that the end time should not exceed the video length. That’s what I fixed.

It was solved but again I’m facing the same issue


@Hisham Kadambot said: [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) I’m still facing the issue.


@Nilay Chugh said: i guess there’s some issue in 5th question as i have correctly filtered the data in OpenRefine 2\-3 times but still getting incorrect in the portal.


@Carlton D'Silva said: OpenRefine question has historically been a tricky question to get right. Check out some past TA sessions in previous term for solving it, or previous discourse posts.


Kind regards

The top line mentions “Saturdays” whereas the bottom line mentions “Sundays”


Please clarify “SUNDAY” or “SATURDAY”?

@Aniruddha Mukherjee said: Update: I tried for both (thank god for filters in Excel) and Sunday is what the question is asking for. The Instruction above for “Saturday” is incorrect\- maybe the logic generating different questions for different students can be tweaked\-


Thank you


@Aniruddha Mukherjee said: I’ve attempted this question several times and I’m fairly certain that the answer to this question is incorrect. I’d be grateful if the answer to this question was re\-checked. I can share the answer I’m certain about here, however I do not think it would be prudent to do so given this is a public forum.


Please consider my request and double check\-
