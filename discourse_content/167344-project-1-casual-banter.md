its necessary that your heart feels good

@Naman S. said: It is good that the practical elements are core in the course though more time should be given for balanced approach between projects and graded assignments.


There were some issues I faced. For example, the GitHub link of the datagen.py was incorrect and I was confused due to the code not generating the expected outcome.


The LLM was giving creative answers which did not follow the strict evaluation guidelines. So, the case was not passed. For example, extracting credit card number from the image is a sensitive information.


I am alright with it since the evaluation will be different.


Now, I am really well versed with the tools taught in these weeks. Thanking the whole TDS Team for this project which was very well designed. ![:grinning:](https://emoji.discourse-cdn.com/google/grinning.png?v=12 ":grinning:")
