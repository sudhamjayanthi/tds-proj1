@Ajit said: Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton),  

My Project 1 scores are not visible on the part, I have definitely submitted before the deadline and on the grades section \- its coming as not submitted. I have mailed support team as well. Will it be possible to check the same in any manner.


Regards,  

Ajit


@Carlton D'Silva said: No one has received their Project 1 scores yet. We are hoping to very soon announce preliminary results. (maybe in 24 hours or so). Depends how many bugs we get bitten by.


Kind regards


@Pradeep Mondal said: [@carlton](/u/carlton) any updates on the Project 1 results?

You failed pre requisites check. Hence there is no evaluation email.  

i.e. the score is 0 which will be pushed to dashboard on after 1/4/25


Only those that passed the pre requisite check got emails with scores.


@HARISH. S said: Sir can you check and say if I passed or not. The link that I submitted for project 1 in the gform contains two links. I wrote ‘and’ between two website link.


My mail id: 23f3000975@ds.study.iitm.ac.in


@Rahul Pathak said: Sir, I hope you’re doing well. I haven’t received any email regarding **Project 1** results. Could you please confirm if there’s an issue?  

my mail id: 23f2000798@ds.study.iitm.ac.in


@Carlton D'Silva said: No issue with your submission, you will get a good score.


Kind regards


@Carlton D'Silva said: Hi you were supposed to provide just one github link in the format specified. You failed to do that and therefore your submission was not evaluated.


Kind regards
