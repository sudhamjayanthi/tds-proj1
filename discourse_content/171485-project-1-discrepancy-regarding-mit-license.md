Sir I thought that the ‘LICENSE’ file had to be renamed to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  

Can you please look into it. Thankyou!


@Jivraj Singh Shekhawat said: Hi [@22f3000585](/u/22f3000585)


Standard MIT License naming criteria is to be named as LICENSE or LICENSE.md(all caps).

Kind regards

Sir, this is why i renamed it to ‘MIT LICENSE’.  

Sir can you please consider it. Thank you!


@PalakAnand said: Same here. I also added and saved the file as MIT license because of the following message. I request you to please consider evaluating the project.

I completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.


But the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.


Unfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.  

Changing it now will not suddenly make it eligible.


These things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.


Its a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.


We had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.


I know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.


Kindest regards


@Reva Lakshmy Paul said: Sir,  

Thankyou for your prompt reply to my query.  

I wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).  

I completely understand what you are trying to convey but that was the sole reason i made that change on the 16th.  

I completely respect your decision but if there is even a slight possibility that you consider it (only because I did it on the 16th) I would highly appreciate it.  

Thankyou!


@Carlton D'Silva said: One thing we are doing is looking at the latest commit before the 18th of Feb. So if it was correct before the 18th of Feb then we will consider it and evaluate it, but it has to be precisely what is expected. If so, then your submission will be evaluated by building the image from the docker manifest in the github present at the version before the 18th.


@Reva Lakshmy Paul said: Well noted sir. Thanks a lot!
