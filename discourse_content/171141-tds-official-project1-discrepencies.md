Who were evaluated? How did we decide what to evaluate?
-------------------------------------------------------


All the image ids we evaluated were what *you* submitted to us. This is the list of docker repos that was given to us by [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) as the official list that met all the pre\-requisites of Project 1\. Therefore we will only evaluate those on this list who are eligible for evaluation with the repos *you* gave us.


For clarity. Your docker repo gets a unique id every time it is changed. We will ONLY evaluate the image id which was present at the time of the docker repo being pulled. This acts as a time stamped frozen version of your repo. No other image id will be evaluated.


How to fix bugs in our scripts

Bug fixes
---------


If you find bugs in our evaluation scripts, you might benefit from more marks because of the bug fix. So it is in your interest to look through our scripts and logs and identify bugs or anomalies. You might just go from 0 to heros.


Kind regards,

@Aarush saxena said: How come me and my group used same code but some got 10 some 11 some 12?


@Yogesh said: [@carlton](/u/carlton) Please make clear what the average marks are, what highest marks are, and how the project will be evaulated.


We are very close to the end semester exam, and we are still not clear on assignment and project marks. It is a bit frustrating to plan in such circumstances.


@Carlton D'Silva said: You have to see the logs for that. We have shared the logs. Everyone was graded by the exact same code, so there is no partiality. Your code did not produce consistent results.


@Dhruv said: I have noticed that my image was run on a `x86_64` architecture ( I can see my email in the logs shared ) whereas I built this docker image on my mac which is `ARM`. This is why I can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error`.


This was never mentioned on which architecture machine, our images will be evaluated. I request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.


@Ritwika Dutta said: My evaluation log file is missing, although I followed all the steps to generate the docker image correctly, it’s showing the server didn’t start for 5 minutes but when I uploaded it, it was working fine. Please help me out sir, I worked hard on the project. I’ll get a zero, but I made the submissions correctly. Some other student also got the “server didn’t start in 5 minutes” but he has an evaluation log file. Please kindly help me out. My roll no. is 22f2001389


@Carlton D'Silva said: We will check and rerun on arm if we ran it on the wrong emulation.


@Ritwika Dutta said: Any suggestions for my case sir ? I’m really tensed.

[@carlton](/u/carlton) same issue, My image was also run on a `x86_64` architecture. I too built on my mac which is `ARM` (M1 Processor). I too can see that my docker image never ran properly and threw the `exec format error` and **Evaluation log file** is MISSING.


Actually my image was run on x86\_64 architecture as it was present in that log file and because of the wrong architecture it never started.


I also request that my evaluation be done again on the right machine.

@AYUSH SINGH said: My evaluation log file is missing.  

The 2 other log files i’m given doesnt have my email inside it listed.  

the Image id which is given in the MAIL is not present in my docker desktop, my project’s docker image is listed in docker desktop, which doesnot matches the image id given in the MAIL,  

What was evaluated? How it was evaluated?


This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: 0ade87d1bf07


My terminal shows 2 images as last, with respective image ids. I am not sure which one is the real, so please check with both the ids.  

tds\-project\-1 latest c854274f078d 5 weeks ago 1\.38GB  

ayush6871/fastapi\-agent latest 27e8375b0ab1 6 weeks ago 1\.66GB


I am requesting to look into this case. I think there has been some mistake somewhere.

@JAHAR KUMAR PAUL said: [@carlton](/u/carlton) Sir , my Docker image is built on Macbook M1 which as you know uses ARM64 architecture . But evaluated with x86\_64 which caused the exec format error due to cross platform compatibility issues . I am kindly requesting you to re\-evaluate the project once again .


@Harsh Jaiswal said: This is the id of the docker image that was evaluated: d0f14a872042 , but i had never provided this docker image then how it get evaluated, also none of the docker image created by me has this id.


Please, look over it.
