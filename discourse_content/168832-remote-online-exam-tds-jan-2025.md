@Bhashwar Sengupta said: Would we be able to start work on the questions 1 hour before the exam start time?


@Carlton D'Silva said: [@bhashwar\_sengupta](/u/bhashwar_sengupta) No that will not be possible. It will go live only at 1 pm.


@Bhashwar Sengupta said: Got it. Thank you. Also, are there any standard set of instructions that we need to follow during the ROE, like in OPPEs?


@Yogesh said: Is it 45 minutes long?


@Vinil said: No, it is 45 minutes ‘short’


@Akshit Mittal said: [@carlton](/u/carlton) will exam take place on the IITM Exam Portal (like other JAVA, Python OPPE) or will it take place on the TDS course portal like we had for Weekly GA?


@Muthupalaniappan said: Hello [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir, I could only find one live session of ROE in youtube. Can you please point out where are the other recordings?


@Carlton D'Silva said: All week 7 sessions are ROE mock solving questions. Only the 4th session was a special session and was labelled as such, but it also has a mock solving component. These are all available on the Youtube channel


@Ashmeet Kaur said: Sir we have to join the google meet for ROE or it’s an open book exam?


@Sridevi said: Is there a google meet that we have to join for proctoring?

I hope the Remote Online Exam (ROE) is ready to be uploaded to the portal. Is there any update regarding the additional time request? Can we expect any consideration on this?
