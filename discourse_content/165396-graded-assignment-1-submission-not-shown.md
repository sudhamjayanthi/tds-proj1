@Muthupalaniappan said: Hello,


I submitted my graded assignment for TDS course. But unfortunately I did not see the question in the portal asking if I have seen all questions and attended the exam. Can someone please clarify if it shall be graded still?

It is saying you did not attempt it because you did not answer the seek portal question.


You are not graded on the seek portal question. It only exists to make sure you saw the GA and attempted it. You are only graded on your submission of GA1 on the actual assignment page where your last saved submission is used for grading.


Kind regards


@Kundan Kumar said: Dear Sir,  

I encountered the same issue as mentioned. Could you please confirm whether GA 1 will still be evaluated under this condition, and if we will receive our actual score based on the last saved submission on the assignment page?


@VENKATESWARLU THATHA said: sir can you please allow us to submit it . like open the seek portal for a few mins . because we have worked hard to finished the assignment and all our hardwork will be in vain … please

@Kundan Kumar said: Hello,  

I accessed the assignment through the provided link and attempted and saved it. But unfortunately I forgot to submit it on my course LMS. I have put in a lot of effort to complete this and I scored 9, so I kindly request you to consider it and provide your clarification on the matter.


@Khushi Shah said: Respected Sir,  

I made the similar mistake of not selecting a yes on the seek IITM portal  

According to your previous replies, does it imply that only the answers submitted through the link provided will be considered for evaluation regardless of the seek portal selection for this time?  

Thanks


@Carlton D'Silva said: [@23f2005471](/u/23f2005471)


Correct! Only scores that were saved in your actual last submission on the ga page itself will be evaluated (the portal question is just to make sure you were aware of the GA and confirm that you attempted it).


Kind regards


@Atharva Athawale said: Respected Sir/Madam,


I have submitted the TDS GA 1 assignment but failed to submit the Yes or NO option in the checkbox  

I request you to please consider my submission as I have scored 6/10 marks in the assignment  

and if you won’t my whole efforts will be lost just because of this

@Thinesh Kumar S said: Dear [@s.anand](/u/s.anand) sir,  

For the TDS week 1 assignment, I have submitted it in the link (this link) that was mentioned in the graded assignment but I did not submit yes in the portal tab. Can you please help me out this one time??


I will make sure I submit it in both places next time.


I kindly request you to help me out this one time, as this will really impact my grade particularly as of this course.  

I got a total of 9\.5 in this assignment but as you can see in the image attached below I erred up with this submission

however, I was unable to submit \[press the yes] on the iitm TDS coursework site.  

I just wanted to confirm that my assignment will be graded and taken into consideration.  

Thank you

@Anshuman Dave said: [@Jivraj](/u/jivraj) [@carlton](/u/carlton) I had made my submission for GA1 on the website and also secured 9/10, image attached as shown. But in the course dashboard i missed out on the trivial step of clicking Yes. Since i am also logged in from my email on the evaluatio website and my score is saved, can iT PLEASE be considered for evaluation.

@Carlton D'Silva said: Hi Mandy,


Your scores will be pushed to the Dashboard from your saved submissions. Ignore the seek Portal result (that was a placeholder question to make students aware that GA had been released).


Kind regards
