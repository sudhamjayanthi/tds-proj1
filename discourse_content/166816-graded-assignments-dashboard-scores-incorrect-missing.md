@Divjot Singh said: Hi, the same issue persists for me for GA 2 and 4\. I also did not attemp GA 3\. Please look into this. My email id: 24ds3000061@ds.study.iitm.ac.in


@Revi said: My Graded assignment results are also not appearing in the dashboard. My email id is 22f2001532@ds.study.iitm.ac.in

Can you check the dashboard now, I’ve been informed by operations that the scores have been pushed.


GA 4 scores will be a little late to be pushed because there are some manual (i.e. automated using a custom written script) corrections that have to be made to Q4 for students who got Nur\-Sultan as their city.


Kind regards


@Revi said: Thanks Carlton. Now the results are visible in the dashboard.


Thanks

I can confirm that our server did record your marks as 7, we will make a correction in the dashboard. Thanks for letting us know. My sincere apologies for the error.


If the marks on the dashboard are not changed within the next 7 days, please let us know. I will follow it up on my end and try to get the correction pushed as soon as possible.
