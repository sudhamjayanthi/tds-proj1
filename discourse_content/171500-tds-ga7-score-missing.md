@Dhruv Agrawal said: [@carlton](/u/carlton) [@POD\_TEAM](/u/pod_team) how to peer review for GA7 where is the link??


@Carlton D'Silva said: Dont worry about seek portal. GA 7 scores will only get pushed once peer reviews are done.  

(roughly 3 days before end term).


Kind regards

What is to be done if the student in question has not done a question? We are required to fill an answer in the quantitative part. We can’t leave it blank.


@Carlton D'Silva said: Just put zero there. Since all the quantitative answers are positive.

@Carlton D'Silva said: You were sent an email about it. With the peers to review. It came from the official TDS email.

@Shambhavi said: Hi [@carlton](/u/carlton) sir,  

I have received the bonus marks email with 5 additional HTML files for peer review. However, I noticed that one of these files was also included in the initial peer grading email.


Could you please clarify if I should fill out the peer review form for this particular file again, or should I skip it since it has already been graded?
